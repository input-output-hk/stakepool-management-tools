      <strong>2.1 Product Specific Terms.</strong> The Daedalus Wallet Terms are
      incorporated by this reference into this Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2.2 Use.</strong> By using Daedalus, User acknowledges and agrees:
    </p>

    <p>
      (i) that the Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying
      protocols and that the Company makes no guarantee of their functionality,
      security, or availability; and
    </p>

    <p>
      (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in
      operating rules (&quot;forks&quot;), and that such forks may materially
      affect the value, and/or function of the ada or any other cryptocurrency
      that User stores on Daedalus. In the event of a fork, User agrees that the
      Company may temporarily suspend Daedalus operations (with or without
      notice to User) and that the Company may, in its sole discretion, (a)
      configure or reconfigure its systems or (b) decide not to support (or
      cease supporting) the forked protocol entirely, provided, however, that
      User will have an opportunity to withdraw funds from Daedalus. User
      acknowledges and agrees that the Company assumes absolutely no
      responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked
      protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.3 Customer Obligations.</strong> User is solely responsible for
      the confidentiality of User&apos;s security devices, information, keys, or
      passwords including safekeeping User&apos;s wallet recovery phrases,
      passwords, private keys, and any other codes User uses to access Daedalus
      or any information, ada, or other cryptocurrency unit. If User loses
      access to User&apos;s cryptocurrency wallet or private keys and has not
      separately stored a backup of User&apos;s wallet recovery phrase(s), User
      acknowledges and agrees that any ada or any other cryptocurrencies User
      has associated with that cryptocurrency wallet will become inaccessible.
      All transactions accepted by Cardano network are irreversible except
      transactions reversed by temporary forks in Cardano network.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2.4 User Wallet Recovery Phrases.</strong> User agrees that User
      should never share User&apos;s wallet recovery phrases (secret keys) with
      any natural or legal person, including the Company. Further, User
      acknowledges that sharing User&apos;s wallet recovery phrase may result in
      loss of User&apos;s ada or any other cryptocurrency, and User agrees that
      the Company shall not be responsible for such loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.5 Liability.</strong> The Company and its shareholders,
      directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents cannot guarantee
      transaction confirmation or the ability to retrieve User&apos;s
      cryptocurrency or wallet recovery phrases, private keys or passwords if
      User loses or forgets them. The Company shall not be responsible for such
      loss howsoever caused. User acknowledges and agrees that ada or any other
      cryptocurrency transactions facilitated by Daedalus and/or the Company may
      be delayed or rejected, and that the Company shall not be responsible for
      any associated loss arising from such delay.

    <h3 className="SubTitleModal">
      Special Terms - Incentivised Testnet, Delegation and Staking{' '}
    </h3>

    <p>
      <strong>3.1 Incentivised Testnet.</strong> Company is testing and making
      available to Users a test rewards and incentivization mechanism which is
      intended to mimic the rewards and incentivization mechanism in the
      upcoming Shelley release (the &quot;Incentivized Testnet&quot;). Users may
      participate in the Incentivized Testnet by delegating their ada stake to
      their own stake pool or to a third party stake pool in exchange for a
      reward equivalent to a percentage of the proceeds generated by the stake
      pool (“Reward”).{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.2 Rewards.</strong> The amount of Rewards a User may earn from
      delegation depends on various factors including, but not limited to, user
      participation, stakepool profit margins and the volume of ada being
      delegated. It is possible that delegation generates no Reward for a User
      due to the above-mentioned factors. Rewards are earned as of the start of
      the 3rd epoch on the Cardano blockchain. When the Incentivized Testnet is
      discontinued, any Rewards earned can be transferred back to the User’s
      Daedalus or Yoroi wallet.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.3 Delegation.</strong> Users may delegate their stake to one of
      the various stake pools of the Company or to a third party stake pool.
      User will have the sole right to determine the volume to be delegated to a
      stake pool and may increase or decrease its level of participation at any
      time. Any information Company shares regarding stakepools, including
      performance metrics and Rewards, will be for indicative purposes only and
      may not be accurate. Users may only delegate their stake to a stake pool
      if their ada is in an updated Daedalus or an updated Yoroi wallet at the
      time of the setup process. User does not acquire any automatic right to
      Rewards as a result of delegating its stake.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.4 Company Stake-Pools.</strong> The Company will operate various
      stake pools which will be visible in Daedalus or the explorer tool. The
      cost and network and server requirements to reliably operate such stake
      pools shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. Company
      will communicate the percentage amount of Reward to be shared with Users
      through the User’s Testnet Daedalus wallet. Rewards will accrue at the end
      of each epoch and will automatically appear in the User’s Testnet Deadalus
      wallet. Company will provide a dashboard detailing the Company’s staking
      performance to User.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.5 Redeeming Rewards.</strong> User acknowledges and agrees that
      by redeeming Rewards in the Incentivised Testnet, User redeems TEST-ADA
      only, and that in order to redeem actual ada, User must repeat the
      procedure in the mainnet, once released. User shall be responsible for
      payment of all applicable taxes, if any, to which the Rewards might be
      subject and any and all other taxes which may apply to User once Rewards
      are redeemed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.6 Tools. </strong>Company will provide Users and stake pool
      operators certain tools designed to estimate the amount of Rewards a User
      may earn on the Incentivized Testnet (“Rewards Calculator”). User
      understands that the Rewards Calculator is provided for illustrative
      purposes only and may not be accurate. Company does not promise that the
      Reward received will correspond to the amount indicated by the Rewards
      Calculator or by the stake pools.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.7 Prohibited Use.</strong> User will not, and will not permit
      any other third party to use any device, software or routine to interfere
      with the proper function of the Incentivised Testnet. If there is a
      complaint or notice of violation, a User’s participation may be suspended
      without notice until resolved, and terminated if not resolved promptly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.8 Warranty. </strong> The Service are provided to User on an “as
      is” and “as available” basis and all warranties, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service are hereby excluded.
      User acknowledges that the Incentivized Testnet may not operate properly
      and that it may contain errors, design flaws or other issues. User’s use
      of the Incentivized Testnet remains at User’s risk and discretion. IOHK
      reserves the right to restart the Incentivised Testnet and reverse all or
      some Rewards in the case of errors and/or malicious behaviour in the
      system.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.9 Termination of the Incentivised Testnet.</strong> User
      understands and agrees that Company may change, withdraw, terminate access
      to and/or discontinue the Incentivized Testnet (or any portion thereof) at
      any time and in its sole discretion. User may end participation in the
      Incentivized Testnet at any time and any Rewards gained up to that time
      will still be transferred to User’s Daedalus or Yoroi mainet wallet once
      the Incentivized Testnet is discontinued.{' '}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3.10 Feedback.</strong> Users may provide suggestions, comments or
      ideas and report issues or problems related to their use of the
      Incentivized Testnet at any time by using any of the official feedback
      channels.
